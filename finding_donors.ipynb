    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve. When there is no benchmark model set, getting a result better than random choice is a place you could start from.\n",

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "**1.SVM:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support vector machines can be used to perform handwriting recognition as well as image recognition. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q.What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "SVM models works well with linear separation and are also well suited to non-linear boundaries. By using the kernel trick which  maps the data points into higher dimensions and then projects them back into the the original space, this model can classify non-linear boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "SVM algorithms can be slow when used with large training sets. \n",
    "It is also susceptible to overfitting issues\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "Support Vector Machines are primarily for binary classification and therefore a good fit for our data which we are trying to classify as income >50K or income <=50K. This model tries to find the boundary that achieves the largest margin or distance from the points and since it works well with a large number of features it should work well in our case where we have 13 features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.Ensemble Methods (adaboost):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaboost is commonly used in classification problems. One common example is its use in face detection. It can be trained to classify an image as containing a face or not based on a set of training images. Each of the training images is identified as containing a face or not and is represented by a value given to every pixel in that image. Once trained, the model can \"recognize\" a face in an image with good accuracy depending on how well it was trained. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q.What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is effective with classification problems when we can provide it a large set of training data to develop the model.\n",
    "It is simple to use, fast, has very few parameters needed to tune it. The model is also relatively fast compared to some other algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaboost is not effective if we do not have training data as it is a supervised training algorithm. It can be susceptible to overfitting if the weak classifiers are too weak or are too complex. This model can also be negatively susceptible to noisy data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q.What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "In our scenario we have a set of points with 13 features each, we are trying to define a boundary between those points marked as income >50K and income <=50K. This fits well with this model as each of the weak learners tries to successively define a boundary to separate the data based on the previous weak learner. Ultimately the set of weak learners combine to create a good classifier (strong learner).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.Naive Bayes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive bayes can be used in spam detection. In other words, it is well suited to classifying emails as being spam or non spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "This model works well when the features are conditionally independent. In the spam example, we apply the fact that certain words are more common in spam emails but in this model we do not consider effect of words in conjunction with each other. This assumption is where the naive part of the model's name is derived. This model is also computationally fast, fairly straight forward to implement and works well with a large number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "This model may perform not so well when there is dependence between the features being used to train the model as mentioned above, the model assumes the features are independent.\n",

    "Q.What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive bayes would be a good candidate for this problem because we have a classification problem. We are given a set of features, using which we are trying to predict the income as either >$50K or <=$50K. Since we know the features these act as our priors or given information, using this known information we can determine the probability of the record being either >$50K or <=$50K.\n",

    "In the concept of boosting, the analogy is the trying to do well in a quiz and using the friends (weak learners) and using their expertise to answer the questions they have knowledge in, in this way we combine each person's expertise to create a strong combined  learner. In a similar way, we take a set of models that are ony slighlty better than a random chance based model and combine them into a model that performs well. \n",
    "In adaboost, we successively apply a best fit model that tries to minimize the clasification errors. Each time a model classifies the data, the errors it produces are magnified such that the successive learner model tries to address those magnified errors as they have a larger penalty on them. At the end of the defined set of iterations, the classifications produced by each of the models are overlayed on top of each other and combined to produce one overall model (strong learner). When we are combining these models (learners), each model is weighted based on how accurate it was or rather how much information it gives us. These weights are applied as we combine the models to produce one overall model that is usually a much more accurate classifier. \n",
    "In terms of our data, we are trying to classify data as income >=50K, so adaboost is a good fit for this problem as it is well suited to classification problems.\n",

This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn.

If we are using a huge amount of data as would be likely in a real world scenario I would think this may be significant as there is a cost of time and processing power that we would have to weigh against the benefit of a small gain in accuracy of our model.
